Indeed, there are many fields where network science is applied, from social science and systems engineering to network medicine and drug interactomes. A drug-drug interactome (DDI) is a complex graph, where the node represents a drug, and an edge represents a drug-drug interaction. Drug-drug interactomes are analyzed with algorithmic and statistical methods to predict previously unaccounted interactions, or to unravel new pharmacological mechanisms. However, for individual patients with specific combinations of drugs, most of the DDI data is irrelevant and noisy. Therefore, our main objective is to build a computer model, based on complex networks, that selects only the individually-relevant drug interactions and then issues corresponding alerts. The novelty of our approach consists of using machine learning algorithms on graph-structured data, e.g., Convolutional Graph Networks. As a result, our personalized drug interaction prediction model will mitigate alert fatigue. To this end, we assemble a multidisciplinary team consisting of pharmacists and computer engineers. The pharmacists provide the pharmacological expertise, which is required as ground truth for machine learning algorithms and model validation. The computer engineers design the network model and implement machine learning algorithms. The end product will be an (experimentally demonstrated) prototype of the smartphone-based personalized alert system, for relevant drug interactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Keywords<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Big data, drug interaction, prediction, alert system<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Complexity science for precision pharmacy: predicting relevant drug interactions using complex network analysis&nbsp; Project Summary Complex network analysis is one of the most important scientific methods for investigating complex systems.
