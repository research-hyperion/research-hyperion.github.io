Due to the complexity problems entailed by multiple (and some unexpected) interactions emerging in therapies that require a simultaneous administration of multiple drugs, in silico models have been proposed in accordance with official documents [1] and other important scientific papers [2][3]. Such recent developments were spurred by the tremendous developments in the field of network science [4][5], including its medical [6][7] and biological [8][9] applications. The network applications to the fields of biochemistry and pharmacology led to modeling the so-called interaction networks or interactomes [7].
